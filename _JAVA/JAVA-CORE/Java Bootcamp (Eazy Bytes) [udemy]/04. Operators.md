# Operators & Operand

Java operators fall into two categories:

- Based on the number of operands they work with.
  1. unary operator: `num++`, `num--`
  2. binary operator: `num1 + num2`
  3. ternary operator: `isEven ? even: odd`
- Based on the type of operation they execute on these operands.
  1. arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
  2. relational operators (comparaison): `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `=>`, `=<`
  3. logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
  4. bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`

# Assignment Operator `=`

- Assignement operator `=` is classified as a binary operator.
- It is right-associative operator: It evaluate from right to left.
  > **Associativity of operators** refers to the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated in an expression.

# Addition Operator

Addition on numeric types are automatically casted following this rule:

1. If one operand is **double**, the other is **converted to double**
1. If one operand is **float**, the other is **converted to float**
1. If one operand is **long**, the other is **converted to long**
1. If none of the above applies, all operands are **converted to int**
